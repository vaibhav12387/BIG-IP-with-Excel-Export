# BIG-IP-with-Excel-Export
This PHP project retrieves and displays F5 BIG-IP configuration details (Virtual Servers and Pool Members) via the F5 REST API. It displays the information on a webpage **and** provides an **"Export to Excel"** button, which generates an Excel workbook with separate sheets for VIPs and pool members.
